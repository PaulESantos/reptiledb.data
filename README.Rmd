T# 🦎 reptiledb.data: Access the Reptile Database in R

`reptiledb.data` provides easy access to the [Reptile Database](http://www.reptile-database.org/), a comprehensive global catalogue of all living reptile species. Developed by **PaulESantos**, this R package includes a complete snapshot of the database as ready-to-use R data objects for taxonomy, biodiversity research, and comparative analyses.

## 🌍 About the Reptile Database

The [Reptile Database](http://www.reptile-database.org/) is a volunteer-driven, non-commercial initiative that curates the global taxonomy of reptiles. It covers all known:

- Snakes 🐍  
- Lizards 🦎  
- Turtles 🐢  
- Amphisbaenians  
- Tuataras  
- Crocodiles 🐊  

It currently includes:

- **Over 10,000 species**
- **Approximately 2,800 subspecies**
- Taxonomic hierarchy (orders, families, genera, species, synonyms)
- Distribution and type locality data
- Literature references and nomenclatural information

Although the focus is on taxonomy, future additions may include ecological and behavioral traits.
